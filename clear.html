<span id="idfh1">clear:</span> When we use float in any div then this div overlap the another div. To avoid this situation we use clear property in css.<br/>
<a id="idfy" href="https://youtu.be/5IVbuwrrqBE" target="_blank">Youtube video link</a>
<br/>It can be written as:
<br/><span id="idf1">clear:left;</span>
<br/>There are 3 values of clear property:
<br/>1.left ( use if in previous div used float:left then left side of not to next div overlap  )
<br/>2.right  ( use if in previous div used float:right then right side  not to next div overlap  )
<br/>3.both ( it is used to avoid overlap of next div wheathere we use left or right float used in previous div)<br/>
